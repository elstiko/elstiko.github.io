* 2015 Onwards: [Ettin Con](https://EttinCon.org) is a gaming convention I started in the Blue Mountains of NSW. Up to twice a year, we host up to 300 people for up to twelve hours per day to play board games, card games, role-playing games and video games. We had to go virtual during the plague, obviously. Here's to a glorious future.
