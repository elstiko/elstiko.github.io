# Role-Playing Games for Kids

The combination of [tweets like this](https://twitter.com/ActiveNick/status/1092228935528706054) and Google+ communities with ~2k members about to be deleted lead me to curating Yet Another List of RPGs for Children. Now that we're all going to be Blogger Refugees again, I can keep coming back to this little markdown file on my laptop and add things as they arise or resurface in my memory.

* [Hero Kids](https://herokidsrpg.blogspot.com/p/hero-kids-overview.html), by (fellow Australian) Justin Halliday is the first *kid-centric* fantasy RPG most people hear about nowadays, and with good reason. It is, from the lens of tactical D&D, a great intro to that style of play.
* The first cousin of that which I ever found on the web was the card-based [Adventure Maximus](https://www.adventuremaximus.com/thegame).
* If your kids want to have more freedom than a single genre, Monte Cook games made a big splash with their two kickstarters for the genreless imaginary mashup of [No Thank You, Evil!](http://www.nothankyouevil.com/)
* Similarly, [Amazing Tales](https://amazing-tales.net/) has multiple options in terms of setting.
* If you want cute little fuzzy characters but your kids aren't able to handle the complexity of Mouse Guard, maybe you'd like to try something like [The Woodlands](http://www.northfiregames.com/the-woodlands/) for a more story-driven Redwall-esque tale, or even [Michtim](http://www.michtim.com/).
* [The Magical Land of Yeld](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/256555/The-Magical-Land-of-Yeld) was born out of the [Modest Medusa](http://modestmedusa.com/) comics, and similarly, you might enjoy [Sidekick Quests](https://sidekickquests.com/learn-the-game/), from the eponymous comic!
* [Fall of Magic](https://heartofthedeernicorn.com/product/fall-of-magic-scroll-edition/?v=6cc98ba2045f) is a beautiful game for any age, the emphasis is on story and characterisation, not at all on any kind of tactical combat. A digital version is also available.
* [Wildlings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/wildlings/wildlings.pdf) might scratch your Lookouts itch, but in a few months, I'll be releasing [my free hack](https://elstiko.github.io/Revising-Wardlings/) to play a kidventure with the Wardlings miniatures - see [wave 1](https://wizkids.com/wardlings-w1/), [wave 2](https://wizkids.com/wardlings-w2/).
* For super-simple systems, you can ditch the dice entirely and flip coins in [FlipTales](https://playfliptales.com/)!
* [Instant RPG](https://wanderinggm.itch.io/instant-rpg) is a free RPG which fits on a business card, is diceless, paperless, and practically ageless!

Oh, and suggestions are welcome, so if you know something I don't, please let me know in the comments! Thanks!
