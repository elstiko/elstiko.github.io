# Itching to Publish?

For those who aren't familiar, [itch.io](https://itch.io) is an indie games marketplace, designed for video games, but just as useful for other digital releases, like tabletop/print-and-play games.

There's been a [huge surge in uploads of physical games](https://itch.io/physical-games) since the publication of [DC's overdue call-to-arms for tabletop game designers to give the platform a try](https://medium.com/@davidcollins562/if-youve-been-keepin-up-with-the-dialogue-that-s-been-brewing-on-twitter-much-of-which-has-been-1c6e55033d1a), and they're right, the monoculture of **OneBookShelf**([DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/), [DM's Guild](https://www.dmsguild.com/), and other faces of the OBS shopfront) is starting to hurt the indie scene as much as it has helped it over the years. Itch is certainly easier to use on both sides (designer and consumer), and they take a much smaller cut of the sale.

Helping [@WanderingGM](https://twitter.com/wanderinggm) publish [Instant RPG](https://wanderinggm.itch.io/instant-rpg) the other day was what motivated me to do more on the platform. I had put our [Tiny D&D business cards](https://ettincon.itch.io/t-d-n-d) up as free-or-donate before, but had many [#NaGaDeMon](https://nagademon.org/about/) files sitting around since November 2018, and decided to quietly release my [Scales & Scoundrels](https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/scales-scoundrels-1) hack of [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/)'s quests-and-resources model, [Secret Dragons](https://elstiko.itch.io/secret-dragons). It sold a copy this morning! Whoo, virtual dollar!

I have a bunch of other tiny hacks which I might put onto the site, just to see if anyone likes them. I'll try to abort any design which develops into something too frighteningly unoriginal, but it's funny how often I'll get a hundred words into a design only to realise that either [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/) did it better, or I'm just unconsciously re-writing [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/), then file it in the *Windows Folder of Despair*. [I'm still working on the Wardlings intro game](https://elstiko.github.io/Revising-Wardlings/) to release after this Winter's [Ettin Con](https://EttinCon.org). I'd love to sell (and potentially expand) it but I'm guessing that [WizKids](https://wizkids.com/wardlings) would prefer me to rename it even if it's the only game specifically devised for their miniatures.

Anyway, if you weren't already thinking about getting your stuff out there, or you were intimidated by the complexity of submitting to DTRPG, maybe give itch a go. I'd love to add more stuff to my private and public collections of creative games on the site.
