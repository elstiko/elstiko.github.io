* 1998 - 2001: [ESN](https://educationallysubnormal.bandcamp.com) were a band I toured/wrote/played/sang with. We played live on the radio, got some airplay, recorded two EPs, one LP and a bunch of b-sides. At our peak, we rotated lead vocals to varying success. It was an amazing experience. My favourite tracks were Cello and Magnetic Drift, but there's a moment in Ultimate Emo which was the greatest jam synchronicity of my life.
