* 1996 - 1997: [Kiln](https://kiln96.bandcamp.com) were a band I wrote and played with. We never really managed to find a suitable singer, or record the other two-thirds of our set, but it was lots of fun while it lasted. We played a single 45-minute song made up of nine movements, the first three available at the link. My favourite was the fourth movement.
